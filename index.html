The local specialties are amajor reason to visit, such as Fuzhou dumplings, Guangbing a type of flatbread, durian cake, and cardamom.Marina Island, specifically the Marina Island Pangkor Resort & Hotel, receives mixed reviews, with guests praising the location as a good stopover for families and noting amenities like a man-made beach and pools. However, common criticisms include dated and poorly maintained facilities, a lack of nearby dining options, and inconsistent service. Some guests reported cleanliness issues and problems with room features, while others found it to be a simple, budget-friendly option.
